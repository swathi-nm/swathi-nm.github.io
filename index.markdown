Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.yale.edu/) at Yale University, where I am advised by [Brandon Ogbunu](https://ogbunulab.yale.edu/). I am interested in understanding the mechanisms and factors that influence the capacity of (pathogenic) microbes to adaptively evolve (i.e., their _**evolvability**_), and what this means for the spread and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

I previously earned my bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences (Genetics) from the University of Cambridge, UK, where I did undergraduate research with [Wei Leong Chew](https://chewlab.github.io/), [John Welch](https://www.welch.gen.cam.ac.uk/GroupPage/Home.html) and [Simon Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/). In between my undergraduate and graduate studies, I worked as a research assistant at the labs of [Swaine Chen](https://swainechen.github.io/) and [Sebastian Maurer-Stroh](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/idlabs/about-us/people/our-investigators/Sebastianms) at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore, where I am originally from. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing the veena, (stress) baking and a warm cup of tea or hot cocoa.
