Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, where I am advised by [Brandon Ogbunu](https://ogbunulab.yale.edu/). I am interested in understanding the mechanisms and factors that influence the capacity of (pathogenic) microbes to adaptively evolve (i.e., their evolvability), and what this means for the spread and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

I am from Singapore and earned my bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences (Genetics) from the University of Cambridge, UK, where I did undergraduate research with [John Welch](https://www.welch.gen.cam.ac.uk/GroupPage/Home.html) and [Simon Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/).
